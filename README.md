# UriCodes

Hello there, I'm putting here my solutions of some problems founded in the contest training site URI - online judge.
The challenges are separated by categorie and in each one we have problems of various levels of difficult.
I've coded the most of it in Python , once I'm practicing this language for future data science works :).
But I also programmed some of these challenges in Java, especially those that fit with object-oriented ideas.
I hope it helps someone who has been stuck in any of these problems or who is just studying too.
